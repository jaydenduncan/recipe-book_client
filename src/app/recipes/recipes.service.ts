With floured hands roll teaspoonful of dough into a ball. Place on cookie sheet. With three fingres together, press ball flat, leaving ridges down the middle. Bake in 400Ã¸F oven for 9 to 12 minutes or until lightly gold. Ella was a neighbor who was ten years older than God when I was a child. She always had these in her cookie jar, and usually would bake a dozen every day since the dough keeps so well. It is one of my all time favorites and I have never tasted them anywhere else."
